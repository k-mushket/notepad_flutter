# notepad_flutter

This Flutter project serves as a training exercise, replicating the functionality of Xiaomi's Note app. It's designed to explore Flutter development through the process of building a functional notepad application.

## Features

- **Note Creation with Auto-Save**: Enables the creation of notes that automatically register the date of creation or last edit. Notes are saved automatically, even if the user forgets to save manually, ensuring no content is lost. Empty notes will not be saved to prevent meaningless storage. The app provides an easy way to revisit previously written text.
- **Preview and Non-Linear Grid Layout**: Each note features a preview alongside other notes, arranged in a non-linear grid to accommodate the uniqueness of each note, including its specific text, length, and save date.
- **Easy Note Deletion with Tactile Feedback**: Notes can be easily deleted through a multi-functional interface, accompanied by pleasant tactile feedback to enhance the user experience.


## Technologies Used

- **Provider**: A state management solution that allows efficient and scalable management of app state, making it easier to build reactive apps with Flutter.
- **Isar**: A fast and scalable database for Flutter and Dart applications, providing asynchronous and reactive data storage solutions that are ideal for high-performance apps.
- **Intl**: Offers internationalization and localization capabilities, enabling apps to support multiple languages and cultural settings seamlessly.
- **Flutter Staggered Grid View**: A Flutter package that provides a widget for displaying elements in a staggered grid pattern. It's useful for creating visually appealing layouts that can adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.
- **Vibration**: Allows Flutter apps to interact with the device's vibration hardware, offering tactile feedback for user interactions or notifications.
